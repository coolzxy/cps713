Hello Professor or TAs,

This is the HTPA part of Assignment 1.

To run it do any of the following:

make test_simple       -- Tests with a 22 byte (2 block) message
make test              -- Tests with a 132 byte (9 block) message in a file
make test16            -- Same as `make test` but uses 16 rounds

or

make && ./htpa filename_or_message key [rounds]


*NOTE:*
You can set the level of debug or turn it on and off in the DEBUG_LEVEL and DEBUG defines in htpa.c accordingly.
If a DEBUG_LEVEL is not set, it'll default to "1".
